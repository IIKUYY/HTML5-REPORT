# Chapter 5
## Video containers
A video file usually contains multiple tracks — a video track (without audio), plus one or more audio tracks (without video). Tracks are usually interrelated. An audio track contains markers within it to help synchronize the audio with the video.
There are lots of video container formats. Some of the most popular include

- MPEG 4, usually with an .mp4 or .m4v extension. The MPEG 4 container is based on Apple’s older QuickTime container (.mov). Movie trailers on Apple’s website still use the older QuickTime container, but movies that you rent from iTunes are delivered in an MPEG 4 container.
- Ogg, usually with an .ogv extension. Ogg is an open standard, open source–friendly, and unencumbered by any known patents. Firefox 3.5, Chrome 4, and Opera 10.5 support — natively, without platform-specific plugins — the Ogg container format, Ogg video (called “Theora”), and Ogg audio (called “Vorbis”). On the desktop, Ogg is supported out-of-the-box by all major Linux distributions, and you can use it on Mac and Windows by installing the QuickTime components or DirectShow filters, respectively. It is also playable with the excellent VLC on all platforms.
- Flash Video, usually with an .flv extension. Flash Video is, unsurprisingly, used by Adobe Flash. Prior to Flash 9.0.60.184 (a.k.a. Flash Player 9 Update 3), this was the only container format that Flash supported. All recent versions of Flash also support the MPEG 4 container.
- WebM, usually with an .webm extension. WebM is a royalty-free, open source–friendly video compression designed specifically for use with HTML5 video, leveraging the VP8 video codec and Vorbis audio codec. It is technically similar to another format, called Matroska. It is supported natively, without platform-specific plugins, in the latest versions of Chromium, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.
- ASF, usually with an .asf extension. The ASF container format was invented by Microsoft for video streaming. It included a delightful - DRM scheme which restricted users from backing up their legally purchased licenses. So, if for some reason you lost your license to the content, they thought you should buy it again.
- Audio Video Interleave, usually with an .avi extension. The AVI container format was invented by Microsoft in a simpler time, when the fact that computers could play video at all was considered pretty amazing. It does not officially support features of more recent container formats like embedded metadata. It does not even officially support most of the modern video and audio codecs in use today. Over time, companies have tried to extend it in generally incompatible ways to support this or that, and it is still the default container format for popular encoders such as MEncoder.

## Video Codecs
When you “watch a video,” your video player is doing at least three things at once:
- Interpreting the container format to find out which video and audio tracks are available, and how they are stored within the file so that it can find the data it needs to decode next
- Decoding the video stream and displaying a series of images on the screen
- Decoding the audio stream and sending the sound to your speakers

A video codec is an algorithm by which a video stream is encoded. Your video player decodes the video stream according to the video codec, then displays a series of images, or “frames,” on the screen.
There are lossy and lossless video codecs. Lossless video is much too big to be useful on the web, so I’ll concentrate on lossy codecs. A lossy video codec means that information is being irretrievably lost during encoding. Like copying an audio cassette tape, you’re losing information about the source video, and degrading the quality, every time you encode.
### H.264
H.264 is also known as “MPEG-4 part 10,” a.k.a. “MPEG-4 AVC,” a.k.a. “MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding.” H.264 was also developed by the MPEG group and standardized in 2003. It aims to provide a single codec for low-bandwidth, low-CPU devices (cell phones); high-bandwidth, high-CPU devices (modern desktop computers); and everything in between. To accomplish this, the H.264 standard is split into “profiles,” which each define a set of optional features that trade complexity for file size. Higher profiles use more optional features, offer better visual quality at smaller file sizes, take longer to encode, and require more CPU power to decode in real-time.
### Theora
Theora evolved from the VP3 codec and has subsequently been developed by the Xiph.org Foundation. Theora is a royalty-free codec and is not encumbered by any known patents other than the original VP3 patents, which have been licensed royalty-free. Although the standard has been “frozen” since 2004, the Theora project (which includes an open source reference encoder and decoder) only released version 1.0 in November 2008 and version 1.1 in September 2009.
### VP8
VP8 is another video codec from On2, the same company that originally developed VP3 (later Theora). Technically, it produces output on par with H.264 High Profile, while maintaining a low decoding complexity on par with H.264 Baseline.

## Audio Codec
Like video codecs, audio codecs are algorithms by which an audio stream is encoded. Like video codecs, there are lossy and lossless audio codecs. And like lossless video, lossless audio is really too big to put on the web. So I’ll concentrate on lossy audio codecs.
decoding the audio stream and turning it into digital waveforms that your speakers then turn into sound. As with video codecs, there are all sorts of tricks to minimize the amount of information stored in the audio stream. And since we’re talking about lossy audio codecs, information is being lost during the recording → encoding → decoding → listening lifecycle. Different audio codecs throw away different things, but they all have the same purpose: to trick your ears into not noticing the parts that are missing.
### MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3
MP3s can contain up to 2 channels of sound. They can be encoded at different bitrates: 64 kbps, 128 kbps, 192 kbps, and a variety of others from 32 to 320. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes and better quality audio, although the ratio of audio quality to bitrate is not linear.
### Advanced audio coding
Advanced Audio Coding is affectionately known as “AAC.” Standardized in 1997, it lurched into prominence when Apple chose it as their default format for the iTunes Store. Originally, all AAC files “bought” from the iTunes Store were encrypted with Apple’s proprietary DRM scheme, called FairPlay. Selected songs in the iTunes Store are now available as unprotected AAC files, which Apple calls “iTunes Plus” because it sounds so much better than calling everything else “iTunes Minus.”
### Vorbis
Vorbis is often called “Ogg Vorbis,” although this is technically incorrect. (“Ogg” is just a container format, and Vorbis audio streams can be embedded in other containers.) Vorbis is not encumbered by any known patents and is therefore supported out-of-the-box by all major Linux distributions and by portable devices running the open source Rockbox firmware. Mozilla Firefox 3.5 supports Vorbis audio files in an Ogg container, or Ogg videos with a Vorbis audio track.
## Encoding Video with miro video convertor
Miro Video Converter is an open source, GPL-licensed program for encoding video in multiple formats. Download it for Mac OS X or Windows. It supports all the output formats mentioned in this chapter. It offers no options beyond choosing a video file and choosing an output format. It can take virtually any video file as input, including DV video produced by consumer-level camcorders. It produces reasonable quality output from most videos. Due to its lack of options, if you are unhappy with the output, you have no recourse but to try another program.
- To start, just launch the Miro Video Converter application.
- Click “Choose file” and select the source video you want to encode.
- The “Pick a Device or Video Format” dropdown menu lists a variety of devices and formats.
- Click the “Convert” button and Miro Video Converter will immediately start encoding your video. 

If you’re satisfied with the video quality, skip ahead to At Last, The Markup to see how to assemble them into a single <video> element that works across browsers. If you’d like to learn more about other tools or video encoding options, read on.
## Encoding OGG Video with Firefogg
Firefogg is an open source, GPL-licensed Firefox extension for encoding Ogg video. To use it, you’ll need to install Mozilla Firefox 3.5 or later, then visit firefogg.org.
- Click “Install Firefogg.” Firefox will prompt whether you really want to allow the site to install an extension. Click “Allow” to continue.
- Firefox will present the standard software installation window. Click “Install” to continue.
- Click “Restart Firefox” to complete the installation.
- After restarting Firefox, firefogg.org will confirm that Firefogg was successfully installed.
- Click “Make Ogg Video” to start the encoding process.
- Click “Select file” to select your source video.
- Firefogg has six “tabs”:
```
1. Presets. The default preset is “web video,” which is fine for our purposes.
2. Encoding range. Encoding video can take a long time. When you’re first getting started, you may want to encode just part of your video (say, the first 30 seconds) until you find a combination of settings you like.
3. Basic quality and resolution control. This is where most of the important options are.
4. Metadata. I won’t cover it here, but you can add metadata to your encoded video like title and author. You’ve probably added metadata to your music collection with iTunes or some other music manager. This is the same idea.
5. Advanced video encoding controls. Don’t mess with these unless you know what you’re doing. (Firefogg offers interactive help on most of these options. Click the “i” symbol next to each option to learn more about it.)
6. Advanced audio encoding controls. Again, don’t mess with these unless you know what you’re doing.
```
- The only options I’m going to cover are in the “Basic quality and resolution control” tab. It contains all the important options:
```
1. Video Quality. This is measured on a scale of 0 (lowest quality) to 10 (highest quality). Higher numbers mean bigger file sizes, so you’ll need to experiment to determine the best size/quality ratio for your needs.
2. Audio Quality. This is measured on a scale of -1 (lowest quality) to 10 (highest quality). Higher numbers mean bigger file sizes, just like the video quality setting.
3. Video Codec. This should always be “theora.”
4. Audio Codec. This should always be “vorbis.”
5. Video Width and Video Height. These defaults to the actual width and height of your source video. If you want to resize the video during encoding, you can change the width (or height) here. Firefogg will automatically adjust the other dimension to maintain the original proportions (so your video won’t end up smooshed or stretched).
```
- Once you’ve fiddled with all the knobs, click “Save Ogg” to start the actual encoding process. Firefogg will prompt you for a filename for the encoded video.
- Firefogg will show a nice progress bar as it encodes your video. All you need to do is wait 

## Batch encoding OGG video with FFMPEG2Theora
If you’re looking at batch encoding a lot of Ogg video files and you want to automate the process, you should definitely check out ffmpeg2theora.
ffmpeg2theora is an open source, GPL-licensed application for encoding Ogg video. Pre-built binaries are available for Mac OS X, Windows, and modern Linux distributions. It can take virtually any video file as input, including DV video produced by consumer-level camcorders.
To use ffmpeg2theora, you need to call it from the command line. (On Mac OS X, open Applications → Utilities → Terminal. On Windows, open your Start Menu → Programs → Accessories → Command Prompt.)

ffmpeg2theora can take a large number of command line flags. (Type ffmpeg2theora --help to read about them all.) I’ll focus on just three of them.
- video-quality Q, where “Q” is a number from 0–10.
- audio-quality Q, where “Q” is a number from -2–10.
- max_size=WxH, where “W” and “H” are the maximum width and height you want for the video. (The “x” in between is really just the letter “x”.) ffmpeg2theora will resize the video proportionally to fit within these dimensions, so the encoded video might be smaller than W×H. 

Ex.
```html
you@localhost$ ffmpeg2theora --videoquality 5
                             --audioquality 1
                             --max_size 320x240
                             pr6.dv
```
## Encoding H.264 with Handbrake
Licensing issues aside, the easiest way to encode H.264 video is HandBrake. HandBrake is an open source, GPL-licensed application for encoding H.264 video. (It used to do other video formats too, but in the latest version the developers have dropped support for most other formats and are focusing all their efforts on H.264 video.) Pre-built binaries are available for Windows, Mac OS X, and modern Linux distributions.
- After you open the HandBrake application, the first thing to do is select your source video. Click the “Source” dropdown button and choose “Video File” to select a file. HandBrake can take virtually any video file as input, including DV video produced by consumer-level camcorders.
- HandBrake will complain that you haven’t set a default directory to save your encoded videos. You can safely ignore this warning, or you can open the options window (under the “Tools” menu) and set a default output directory.
- On the right-hand side is a list of presets. Selecting the “iPhone & iPod Touch” preset will set most of the options you need.
- One important option that is off by default is the “Web optimized” option. Selecting this option reorders some of the metadata within the encoded video so you can watch the start of the video while the rest is downloading in the background. I highly recommend always checking this option. It does not affect the quality or file size of the encoded video, so there’s really no reason not to.
- In the “Picture” tab, you can set the maximum width and height of the encoded video. You should also select the “Keep Aspect Ratio” option to ensure that HandBrake doesn’t smoosh or stretch your video while resizing it.
- In the “Video” tab, you can set four important options.
```
- Video Codec. Make sure this is “H.264 (x264)”
- 2-Pass Encoding. If this is checked, HandBrake will run the video encoder twice. The first time, it just analyzes the video, looking for things like color composition, motion, and scene breaks. The second time, it actually encodes the video using the information it learned during the first pass. As you might expect, this takes about twice as long as single-pass encoding, but it results in better video without increasing file size. I always enable two-pass encoding for H.264 video. Unless you’re building the next YouTube and encoding videos 24 hours a day, you should probably use two-pass encoding too.
- Turbo First Pass. Once you enable 2-pass encoding, you can get a little bit of time back by enabling “turbo first pass.” This reduces the amount of work done in the first pass (analyzing the video), while only slightly degrading quality. I usually enable this option, but if quality is of the utmost importance to you, you should leave it disabled.
- Quality. There are different ways to specify the “quality” of your encoded video. You can set a target file size, and HandBrake will do its best to ensure that your encoded video is not larger than that. You can set an average “bitrate,” which is the quite literally the number of bits required to store one second worth of encoded video. (It’s called an “average” bitrate because some seconds will require more bits than others.) Or you can specify a constant quality, on a scale of 0 to 100%. Higher numbers will result in better quality but larger files. There is no single right answer for what quality setting you should use.
```
- In the “Audio” tab, you probably don’t need to change anything. If your source video has multiple audio tracks, you might need to select which one you want in the encoded video. If your video is mostly a person talking (as opposed to music or general ambient sounds), you can probably reduce the audio bitrate to 96 kbps or so. Other than that, the defaults you inherited from the “iPhone” preset should be fine.
- Next, click the “Browse” button and choose a directory and filename to save your encoded video.
- Finally, click “Start” to start encoding.
- HandBrake will display some progress statistics while it encodes your video.

## Batch encoding H.264 video with Handbrake
HandBrake also comes in a command-line edition. As with ffmpeg2theora, the command-line edition of HandBrake offers a dizzying array of options. (Type HandBrakeCLI --help to read about them.) I’ll focus on just a few:
- preset "X", where “X” is the name of a HandBrake preset. The preset you want for H.264 web video is called “iPhone & iPod Touch”, and it’s important to put the entire name in quotes.
- width W, where “W” is the width of your encoded video. HandBrake will automatically adjust the height to maintain the original video’s proportions.
- vb Q, where “Q” is the average bitrate (measured in kilobits per second).
- two-pass, which enables 2-pass encoding.
- turbo, which enables turbo first pass during 2-pass encoding.
- input F, where “F” is the filename of your source video.
- output E, where “E” is the destination filename for your encoded video.

Ex.
```html
you@localhost$ HandBrakeCLI --preset "iPhone & iPod Touch"
                            --width 320
                            --vb 600
                            --two-pass
                            --turbo
                            --input pr6.dv
                            --output pr6.mp4
```
## Encoding WEMB video with FFMPEG
WebM is fully supported in ffmpeg 0.6 and later. On the command line, run ffmpeg with no parameters and verify that it was compiled with VP8 support:
```html
you@localhost$ ffmpeg
FFmpeg version SVN-r23197, Copyright (c) 2000-2010 the FFmpeg developers
  built on May 19 2010 22:32:20 with gcc 4.4.3
  configuration: --enable-gpl --enable-version3 --enable-nonfree --enable-postproc --enable-pthreads --enable-libfaac --enable-libfaad --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libopencore-amrnb --enable-libopencore-amrwb --enable-libtheora --enable-libx264 --enable-libxvid --enable-x11grab --enable-libvorbis --enable-libvpx
  ```
 If you don’t see the magic words “--enable-libvorbis” and “--enable-libvpx,” you don’t have the right version of ffmpeg. (If you compiled ffmpeg yourself, check to see if you have two versions installed. That’s fine, they won’t conflict with each other. You’ll just need to use the full path of the VP8-enabled version of ffmpeg.)
 I’m going to do a two-pass encode. Pass 1 just scans through the input video file (-i pr6.dv) and writes out some statistics to a log file (which will be auto-named pr6.dv-0.log). I specify the video codec with the -vcodec parameter:
```html
you@localhost$ ffmpeg -pass 1 -passlogfile pr6.dv -threads 16  -keyint_min 0 -g 250 -skip_threshold 0 -qmin 1 -qmax 51 -i pr6.dv -vcodec libvpx -b 614400 -s 320x240 -aspect 4:3 -an -y NUL
```
For the second pass, ffmpeg will read the statistics it wrote during the first pass and actually do the encoding of the video and the audio. It will write out a .webm file.
```html
you@localhost$ ffmpeg -pass 2 -passlogfile pr6.dv -threads 16  -keyint_min 0 -g 250 -skip_threshold 0 -qmin 1 -qmax 51 -i pr6.dv -vcodec libvpx -b 614400 -s 320x240 -aspect 4:3 -acodec libvorbis -y pr6.webm
```
There are five important parameters here:
- vcodec libvpx specifies that we’re encoding with the VP8 video codec. WebM always uses VP8 video.
- b 614400 specifies the bitrate. Unlike other formats, libvpx expects the bitrate in actual bits, not kilobits. If you want a 600 kbps video, multiply 600 by 1024 to get 614400.
- s 320x240 specifies the target size, width by height.
- aspect 4:3 specifies the aspect ratio of the video. Standard definition video is usually 4:3, but most high-definition video is 16:9 or 16:10. In my testing, I found that I had to specify this explicitly on the command line, instead of relying on ffmpeg to autodetect it.
- acodec libvorbis specifies that we’re encoding with the Vorbis audio codec. WebM always uses Vorbis audio.

## The Markup
HTML5 gives you two ways to include video on your web page. Both of them involve the <video> element. If you only have one video file, you can simply link to it in a src attribute. This is remarkably similar to including an image with an <img src="..."> tag.
```html
<video src="pr6.webm"></video>
```
Technically, that’s all you need. But just like an <img> tag, you should always include width and height attributes in your <video> tags. The width and height attributes can be the same as the maximum width and height you specified during the encoding process. Don’t worry if one dimension of the video is a little smaller than that. Your browser will center the video inside the box defined by the <video> tag. It won’t ever be smooshed or stretched out of proportion.
```html
<video src="pr6.webm" width="320" height="240"></video>
```
If you don’t want to build your own interface, you can tell the browser to display a built-in set of controls. To do this, just include the controls attribute in your <video> tag.
```html
<video src="pr6.webm" width="320" height="240" controls></video>
```
There are two other optional attributes I want to mention before we go any further: preload and autoplay. Don’t shoot the messenger; let me explain why these are useful. The preload attribute tells the browser that you would like it to start downloading the video file as soon as the page loads. This makes sense if the entire point of the page is to view the video. On the other hand, if it’s just supplementary material that only a few visitors will watch, then you can set preload to none to tell the browser to minimize network traffic.

Here’s an example of a video that will start downloading (but not playing) as soon as the page loads:
```html
<video src="pr6.webm" width="320" height="240" preload></video>
```
And here’s an example of a video that will not start downloading as soon as the page loads:
```html
<video src="pr6.webm" width="320" height="240" preload="none"></video>
```
Here’s an example of a video that will start downloading and playing as soon as possible after the page loads:
```html
<video src="pr6.webm" width="320" height="240" autoplay></video>
```
And here is a Greasemonkey script that you can install in your local copy of Firefox that prevents HTML5 video from playing automatically. It uses the autoplay DOM attribute defined by HTML5, which is the JavaScript equivalent of the autoplay attribute in your HTML markup. [disable_video_autoplay.user.js]
```html
// ==UserScript==
// @name           Disable video autoplay
// @namespace      http://diveintomark.org/projects/greasemonkey/
// @description    Ensures that HTML5 video elements do not autoplay
// @include        *
// ==/UserScript==

var arVideos = document.getElementsByTagName('video');
for (var i = arVideos.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    var elmVideo = arVideos[i];
    elmVideo.autoplay = false;
}
```
Ex. 3 video diferent encoding
```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="pr6.mp4"  type="video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2">
  <source src="pr6.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=vp8,vorbis">
  <source src="pr6.ogv"  type="video/ogg; codecs=theora,vorbis">
</video>
```
## MIME type
What’s the proper MIME type? You’ve already seen it; it’s part of the value of the type attribute on a <source> element. But setting the type attribute in your HTML markup is not sufficient. You also need to ensure that your web server includes the proper MIME type in the Content-Type HTTP header.

If you’re using the Apache web server or some derivative of Apache, you can use an AddType directive in your site-wide httpd.conf or in an .htaccess file in the directory where you store your video files. (If you use some other web server, consult your server’s documentation on how to set the Content-Type HTTP header for specific file types.)

AddType video/ogg .ogv
AddType video/mp4 .mp4
AddType video/webm .webm
