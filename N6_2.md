## Geolocation
The geolocation API lets you share your location with trusted web sites. The latitude and longitude are available to JavaScript on the page, which in turn can send it back to the remote web server and do fancy location-aware things like finding local businesses or showing your location on a map.
## Code Example
The geolocation API centers around a new property on the global navigator object: navigator.geolocation.
The simplest use of the geolocation API looks like this:
```
function get_location() {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(show_map);
}
```
That has no detection, no error handling, and no options. Your web application should probably include at least the first two of those. To detect support for the geolocation API, you can use Modernizr:
```
function get_location() {
  if (Modernizr.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(show_map);
  } else {
    // no native support; maybe try a fallback?
  }
}
```
geolocation support is opt-in. That means your browser will never force you to reveal your current physical location to a remote server. The user experience differs from browser to browser. In Mozilla Firefox, calling the getCurrentPosition() function of the geolocation API will cause the browser to pop up an “infobar” at the top of the browser window. The infobar looks like this:

There’s a lot going on here. You, as the end user,

- are told that a website wants to know your location
- are told which website wants to know your location
- can click through to Mozilla’s “Location-Aware Browsing” help page which explains what the heck is going on (short story: Google provides the location and stores your data in accordance with its Location Service Privacy Policy)
- can choose to share your location
- can choose not to share your location
- can tell your browser to remember your choice (either way, share or don’t share) so you never see this infobar again on this website


Furthermore, this infobar is

non-modal, so it won’t prevent you from switching to another browser window or tab
tab-specific, so it will disappear if you switch to another browser window or tab and reappear when you switch back to the original tab
unconditional, so there is no way for a website to bypass it
blocking, so there is no chance that the website can determine your location while it’s waiting for your answer
The callback function will be called with a single parameter, an object with two properties: coords and timestamp. The timestamp is just that, the date and time when the location was calculated.
The callback function looks like this:
```
function show_map(position) {
  var latitude = position.coords.latitude;
  var longitude = position.coords.longitude;
  // let's show a map or do something interesting!
}
```
## Handling errors
Geolocation is complicated. Things can go wrong. I’ve mentioned the “user consent” angle already. If your web application wants the user’s location but the user doesn’t want to give it to you, you’re screwed. The user always wins. But what does that look like in code? It looks like the second argument to the getCurrentPosition() function: an error handling callback function.
```
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  show_map, handle_error)
```
If anything goes wrong, your error callback function will be called with a PositionError object.
The code property will be one of
- PERMISSION_DENIED (1) if the user clicks that “Don’t Share” button or otherwise denies you access to their location.
- POSITION_UNAVAILABLE (2) if the network is down or the positioning satellites can’t be contacted.
- TIMEOUT (3) if the network is up but it takes too long to calculate the user’s position. How long is “too long”? I’ll show you how to define that in the next section.

## Options
Some popular mobile devices — like the iPhone and Android phones — support two methods of figuring out where you are. The first method triangulates your position based on your relative proximity to different cellular towers operated by your phone carrier. This method is fast and doesn’t require any dedicated GPS hardware, but it only gives you a rough idea of where you are. Depending on how many cell towers are in your area, “a rough idea” could be as little as one city block or as much as a kilometer in every direction.

The second method actually uses dedicated GPS hardware on your device to talk to dedicated GPS positioning satellites that are orbiting the Earth. GPS can usually pinpoint your location within a few meters. The downside is that the dedicated GPS chip on your device draws a lot of power, so phones and other general purpose mobile devices usually turn off the chip until it’s needed. That means there will be a startup delay while the chip is initializing its connection with the GPS satellites in the sky.

The reason I mention this is that, depending on your web application, you may not need high accuracy. If you’re just looking for nearby movie listings, a “low accuracy” location is probably good enough. There aren’t that many movie theaters, even in dense cities, and you’ll probably be listing more than one of them anyway. On the other hand, if you’re giving turn by turn directions in real time, you really do need to know exactly where the user is so you can say “turn right in 20 meters” or whatever.

The enableHighAccuracy property is exactly what it sounds like. If true, and the device can support it, and the user consents to sharing their exact location, then the device will try to provide it. Both iPhones and Android phones have separate permissions for low- and high-accuracy positioning, so it is possible that calling getCurrentPosition() with enableHighAccuracy:true will fail, but calling with enableHighAccuracy:false would succeed.

The timeout property is the number of milliseconds your web application is willing to wait for a position. This timer doesn’t start counting down until after the user gives permission to even try to calculate their position. You’re not timing the user; you’re timing the network.

The maximumAge property allows the device to answer immediately with a cached position. For example, let’s say you call getCurrentPosition() for the first time, the user consents, and your success callback function is called with a position that was calculated at exactly 10:00 AM. Exactly one minute later, at 10:01 AM, you call getCurrentPosition() again with a maximumAge property of 75000.

Before you ask for the user’s location, you should think about just how much accuracy you need, and set enableHighAccuracy accordingly. If you need to find their location more than once, you should think about how old the information could be and still be useful, and set maximumAge accordingly. If you need to find their location continuously, then getCurrentPosition() is not for you. You need to upgrade to watchPosition().

The watchPosition() function has the same structure as getCurrentPosition(). It takes two callback functions, a required one for success and an optional one for error conditions, and it can also take an optional PositionOptions object that has all the same properties you just learned about. The difference is that your callback function will be called every time the user’s location changes.
## Geoposition.js
geoPositon.js is an open source, MIT-licensed JavaScript library that smooths over the differences between the W3C geolocation API, IP geolocation services, and the APIs provided by mobile platforms. To use it, you’ll need to add one <script> element at the bottom of your page. (Technically, you could put it anywhere, but scripts in your <head> will make your page load more slowly. So don’t do that!)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Dive Into HTML5</title>
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <script src="geoPosition.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
Now you’re ready to use whichever geolocation API is installed.
```
if (geoPosition.init()) {
  geoPosition.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);
}
```
