## Cache manifest
An offline web application revolves around a cache manifest file. What’s a manifest file? It’s a list of all of the resources that your web application might need to access while it’s disconnected from the network. In order to bootstrap the process of downloading and caching these resources, you need to point to the manifest file, using a manifest attribute on your <html> element.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html manifest="/cache.manifest">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```
Your cache manifest file can be located anywhere on your web server, but it must be served with the content type text/cache-manifest. If you are running an Apache-based web server, you can probably just put an AddType directive in the .htaccess file at the root of your web directory.
OK, so every one of your HTML pages points to your cache manifest file, and your cache manifest file is being served with the proper Content-Type header. But what goes in the manifest file? This is where things get interesting.

The first line of every cache manifest file is this:
``CACHE MANIFEST``
After that, all manifest files are divided into three parts: the “explicit” section, the “fallback” section, and the “online whitelist” section. Each section has a header, on its own line. If the manifest file doesn’t have any section headers, all the listed resources are implicitly in the “explicit” section. Try not to dwell on the terminology, lest your head explode.

Here is a valid manifest file. It lists three resources: a CSS file, a JavaScript file, and a JPEG image.
```
CACHE MANIFEST
/clock.css
/clock.js
/clock-face.jpg
```
This cache manifest file has no section headers, so all the listed resources are in the “explicit” section by default. Resources in the “explicit” section will get downloaded and cached locally, and will be used in place of their online counterparts whenever you are disconnected from the network. Thus, upon loading this cache manifest file, your browser would download clock.css, clock.js, and clock-face.jpg from the root directory of your web server. Then you could unplug your network cable and refresh the page, and all of those resources would be available offline.
### Network sections
Here is a slightly more complicated example. Suppose you want your clock application to track visitors, using a tracking.cgi script that is loaded dynamically from an <img src> attribute. Caching this resource would defeat the purpose of tracking, so this resource should never be cached and never be available offline. Here is how you do that:
```
CACHE MANIFEST
NETWORK:
/tracking.cgi
CACHE:
/clock.css
/clock.js
/clock-face.jpg
```
This cache manifest file includes section headers. The line marked NETWORK: is the beginning of the “online whitelist” section. Resources in this section are never cached and are not available offline.
### Fallback section
There is one more type of section in a cache manifest file: a fallback section. In a fallback section, you can define substitutions for online resources that, for whatever reason, can’t be cached or weren’t cached successfully. The HTML5 specification offers this clever example of using a fallback section:
```
CACHE MANIFEST
FALLBACK:
/ /offline.html
NETWORK:
*
```
That’s what this cache manifest does. Suppose every HTML page (entry, talk page, edit page, history page) on Wikipedia pointed to this cache manifest file. When you visit any page that points to a cache manifest, your browser says “hey, this page is part of an offline web application, is it one I know about?” If your browser hasn’t ever downloaded this particular cache manifest file, it will set up a new offline “appcache” (short for “application cache”), download all the resources listed in the cache manifest, and then add the current page to the appcache.

Now look at the fallback section. The fallback section in this cache manifest only has a single line. The first part of the line (before the space) is not a URL. It’s really a URL pattern. The single character (/) will match any page on your site, not just the home page. When you try to visit a page while you’re offline, your browser will look for it in the appcache. If your browser finds the page in the appcache (because you visited it while online, and the page was implicitly added to the appcache at that time), then your browser will display the cached copy of the page. If your browser doesn’t find the page in the appcache, instead of displaying an error message, it will display the page /offline.html, as specified in the second half of that line in the fallback section.
## Flow of the events
So far, I’ve talked about offline web applications, the cache manifest, and the offline application cache (“appcache”) in vague, semi-magical terms. Things are downloaded, browsers make decisions, and everything Just Works. You know better than that, right? I mean, this is web development we’re talking about. Nothing ever Just Works.

First, let’s talk about the flow of events. Specifically, DOM events. When your browser visits a page that points to a cache manifest, it fires off a series of events on the window.applicationCache object. I know this looks complicated, but trust me, this is the simplest version I could come up with that didn’t leave out important information.
1. As soon as it notices a manifest attribute on the <html> element, your browser fires a checking event. (All the events listed here are fired on the window.applicationCache object.) The checking event is always fired, regardless of whether you have previously visited this page or any other page that points to the same cache manifest.
2. If your browser has never seen this cache manifest before...
    - It will fire a downloading event, then start to download the resources listed in the cache manifest.
    - While it’s downloading, your browser will periodically fire progress events, which contain information on how many files have been downloaded already and how many files are still queued to be downloaded.
    - After all resources listed in the cache manifest have been downloaded successfully, the browser fires one final event, cached. This is your signal that the offline web application is fully cached and ready to be used offline. That’s it; you’re done.
3. On the other hand, if you have previously visited this page or any other page that points to the same cache manifest, then your browser already knows about this cache manifest. It may already have some resources in the appcache. It may have the entire working offline web application in the appcache. So now the question is, has the cache manifest changed since the last time your browser checked it?
    - If the answer is no, the cache manifest has not changed, your browser will immediately fire a noupdate event. That’s it; you’re done.
    - If the answer is yes, the cache manifest has changed, your browser will fire a downloading event and start re-downloading every single resource listed in the cache manifest.
    - While it’s downloading, your browser will periodically fire progress events, which contain information on how many files have been downloaded already and how many files are still queued to be downloaded.
    - After all resources listed in the cache manifest have been re-downloaded successfully, the browser fires one final event, updateready. This is your signal that the new version of your offline web application is fully cached and ready to be used offline. The new version is not yet in use. To “hot-swap” to the new version without forcing the user to reload the page, you can manually call the window.applicationCache.swapCache() function.

If, at any point in this process, something goes horribly wrong, your browser will fire an error event and stop. Here is a hopelessly abbreviated list of things that could go wrong:
- The cache manifest returned an HTTP error 404 (Page Not Found) or 410 (Permanently Gone).
- The cache manifest was found and hadn’t changed, but the HTML page that pointed to the manifest failed to download properly.
- The cache manifest changed while the update was being run.
- The cache manifest was found and had changed, but the browser failed to download one of the resources listed in the cache manifest.

## Debuging
I want to call out two important points here. The first is something you just read, but I bet it didn’t really sink in, so here it is again: if even a single resource listed in your cache manifest file fails to download properly, the entire process of caching your offline web application will fail. Your browser will fire the error event, but there is no indication of what the actual problem was. This can make debugging offline web applications even more frustrating than usual.
The second important point is something that is not, technically speaking, an error, but it will look like a serious browser bug until you realize what’s going on. It has to do with exactly how your browser checks whether a cache manifest file has changed. This is a three-phase process. This is boring but important, so pay attention.
1. Via normal HTTP semantics, your browser will check whether the cache manifest has expired. Just like any other file being served over HTTP, your web server will typically include meta-information about the file in the HTTP response headers. Some of these HTTP headers (Expires and Cache-Control) tell your browser how it is allowed to cache the file without ever asking the server whether it has changed. This kind of caching has nothing to do with offline web applications. It happens for pretty much every HTML page, stylesheet, script, image, or other resource on the web.
2. If the cache manifest has expired (according to its HTTP headers), then your browser will ask the server whether there is a new version, and if so, the browser will download it. To do this, your browser issues an HTTP request that includes that last-modified date of the cache manifest, which your web server included in the HTTP response headers the last time your browser downloaded the manifest file. If the web server determines that the manifest file hasn’t changed since that date, it will simply return a 304 (Not Modified) status. Again, none of this is specific to offline web applications. This happens for essentially every kind of resource on the web.
3. If the web server thinks the manifest file has changed since that date, it will return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code, followed by the contents of the new file, along with new Cache-Control headers and a new last-modified date, so that steps 1 and 2 will work properly the next time. (HTTP is cool; web servers are always planning for the future. If your web server absolutely must send you a file, it does everything it can to ensure that it doesn’t need to send it twice for no reason.) Once it’s downloaded the new cache manifest file, your browser will check the contents against the copy it downloaded last time. If the contents of the cache manifest file are the same as they were last time, your browser won’t re-download any of the resources listed in the manifest.

So here’s one thing you should absolutely do: reconfigure your web server so that your cache manifest file is not cacheable by HTTP semantics. If you’re running an Apache-based web server, these two lines in your .htaccess file will do the trick:
```
ExpiresActive On
ExpiresDefault "access"
```
Once you’ve disabled HTTP caching on the cache manifest file itself, you’ll still have times where you’ve changed one of the resources in the appcache, but it’s still at the same URL on your web server. Here, step 2 of the three-phase process will screw you. If your cache manifest file hasn’t changed, the browser will never notice that one of the previously cached resources has changed. Consider the following example:
```
CACHE MANIFEST
# rev 42
clock.js
clock.css
```
If you change clock.css and redeploy it, you won’t see the changes, because the cache manifest file itself hasn’t changed. Every time you make a change to one of the resources in your offline web application, you’ll need to change the cache manifest file itself. This can be as simple as changing a single character. The easiest way I’ve found to accomplish this is to include a comment line with a revision number. Change the revision number in the comment, then the web server will return the newly changed cache manifest file, your browser will notice that the contents of the file have changed, and it will kick off the process to re-download all the resources listed in the manifest.
```
CACHE MANIFEST
# rev 43
clock.js
clock.css
```
