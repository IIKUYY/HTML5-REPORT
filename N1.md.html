<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=1 data-line-end=2><a id="MIME_Types_1"></a>MIME Types</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">The MIME types are a hidden label that the browser use to determine what type of content show, this “headers” are use to clasificate all the media in the internet, from videos to PDF, everything has a MIME type in order to display the thing you are looking for.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=4 data-line-end=5><a id="How_standars_were_made_4"></a>How standars were made</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">When the web was just starting, the people who were responsible for the crestion of the early browser, use to discuss what kind of tags and functions, the languages need in order to give a more complete expirience to the developers, in this emails they wrote their opinions and suggestions that later the comunite universaly use and accept, some of this ideas were implemented inmediatly, and other until more recent versions of HTML.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8><a id="HTML_Timeline_from_19972004_7"></a>HTML Timeline from 1997-2004</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">In december 1997 the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) release HTML 4.0 and shut down HTML Working Group an 3 months later published XML 1.0, they did this to have a fresh start to work with, and in 1998 reformulated into XHTML. In 1999 W3C published XHTML Extended form, the reason, they considered that the next generation can´t be compatible with previous versions of HTML, so they started a new clean form model, months later XHTML Extended Forms was renamed to XForms and finally publishes XForms 1.0 in 2003.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=10 data-line-end=11><a id="XHTML_10"></a>XHTML</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="13">When the change from HTML to XHTML ocurred, the old webs written in HTML need to use MIME type application/xhtml+xm, but this is a less forgiving format, leading to 99% of the pages poping a new error<br>
Draconian error handling&quot; this error based on the Greek leader Draco that instuted death penalty in minor crimes, was visible when a minor code error was presented, this was “solved” with a loophole, in XHTML 1.0 the users could use MIME type text/html, and was displayed normally as XHTML, this was parched inmediatly in XHTML 1.1 but must of the page with errors continue to use text/html as MIME type.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=14 data-line-end=15><a id="A_Competing_Vision_14"></a>A Competing Vision</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">In June 2004 the W3C held the Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents, were representatives of Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software gave a presentation on their competing vision of the future of the web, an evolution of HTML 4.0 The following seven principles were the main point in the conference.</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">Backwards compatibility, clear migration path</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">Well-defined error handling</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">Users should not be exposed to authoring errors</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">Practical use</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">Scripting is here to stay</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23">Device-specific profiling should be avoided</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="25">Open process</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">After this process the W3C determined that they will develop more extensions for HTML an CSS, the people who proposed Evolving HTML into HTML Forms leave the W3C and founded the WHAT Working Group in 2004.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=27 data-line-end=28><a id="WHAT_working_group_27"></a>WHAT working group</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">The Web Hypertext Applications Technology Working Group is a loose, unofficial, and open collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and interested parties, The main focus up to this point has been extending HTML4 Forms to support features requested by authors, without breaking backwards compatibility with existing content, after 5 years, the WHAT working group develop an algorithm that could help the HTML users to adress the errors and patch them in order to be compatible with modern web pages</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=30 data-line-end=31><a id="W3C_30"></a>W3C</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="32">After two and a half year ignoring each other, the W3C and the WHAT Working Group announced in 2006 that they will work together to evolve HTML, The plan is to charter a completely new HTML group. Unlike the previous one, this one will be chartered to do incremental improvements to HTML, as also in parallel xHTML. It will have a different chair and staff contact. It will work on HTML and xHTML together. We have strong support for this group, from many people we have talked to, including browser makers.</p>
