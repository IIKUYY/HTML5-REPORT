# HTML5 Storage
So what is HTML5 Storage? Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server
check for support
```javascript
if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}
```
## Using HTML5 Storage
HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.
```javascript
interface Storage {
  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);
};
```
Like other JavaScript objects, you can treat the localStorage object as an associative array. Instead of using the getItem() and setItem() methods, you can simply use square brackets. For example, this snippet of code:
```javascript
var foo = localStorage["bar"];
// ...
localStorage["bar"] = foo;
```
There are also methods for removing the value for a given named key, and clearing the entire storage area (that is, deleting all the keys and values at once).
```javascript
interface Storage {
  deleter void removeItem(in DOMString key);
  void clear();
};
```
Finally, there is a property to get the total number of values in the storage area, and to iterate through all of the keys by index (to get the name of each key).
```javascript
interface Storage {
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
  getter DOMString key(in unsigned long index);
};
```
### Tracking Changes
If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event. The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something. For example, if you set an item to its existing value or call clear() when there are no named keys, the storage event will not fire, because nothing actually changed in the storage area.
```javascript
if (window.addEventListener) {
  window.addEventListener("storage", handle_storage, false);
} else {
  window.attachEvent("onstorage", handle_storage);
};
```
The handle_storage callback function will be called with a StorageEvent object, except in Internet Explorer where the event object is stored in window.event.
```javascript
function handle_storage(e) {
  if (!e) { e = window.event; }
}
```
``At this point, the variable e will be a StorageEvent object, which has the following useful properties.``
| Property | Type   | Description                                                           |
|----------| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| key      | string | the named key that was added, removed, or modified                    |
| oldValue | any    | the previous value (now overwritten), or null if a new item was added |
| newValue | any    | the new value, or null if an item was removed                         |
| url      | string | the page which called a method that triggered this change             |
The storage event is not cancelable. From within the handle_storage callback function, there is no way to stop the change from occurring. It’s simply a way for the browser to tell you, “hey, this just happened. There’s nothing you can do about it now; I just wanted to let you know.”
### Limitations
“5 megabytes” is how much storage space each origin gets by default. This is surprisingly consistent across browsers, although it is phrased as no more than a suggestion in the HTML5 Storage specification. One thing to keep in mind is that you’re storing strings, not data in its original format. If you’re storing a lot of integers or floats, the difference in representation can really add up. Each digit in that float is being stored as a character, not in the usual representation of a floating point number.
## Beyond Named Key-Values Pairs
Web SQL Database (formerly known as “WebDB”) provides a thin wrapper around a SQL database, allowing you to do things like this from JavaScript:
```javascript
openDatabase('documents', '1.0', 'Local document storage', 5*1024*1024, function (db) {
  db.changeVersion('', '1.0', function (t) {
    t.executeSql('CREATE TABLE docids (id, name)');
  }, error);
});
```
It is against this backdrop that I will introduce you to another competing vision for advanced, persistent, local storage for web applications: the Indexed Database API, formerly known as “WebSimpleDB,” now affectionately known as “IndexedDB.”

The Indexed Database API exposes what’s called an object store. An object store shares many concepts with a SQL database. There are “databases” with “records,” and each record has a set number of “fields.” Each field has a specific datatype, which is defined when the database is created. You can select a subset of records, then enumerate them with a “cursor.” Changes to the object store are handled within “transactions.”
