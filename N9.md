# Chapter 9
## Placeholder Text
The first improvement HTML5 brings to web forms is the ability to set placeholder text in an input field. Placeholder text is displayed inside the input field as long as the field is empty. When you click on (or tab to) the input field and start typing, the placeholder text disappears.
Here’s how you can include placeholder text in your own web forms:
```html
<form>
  <input name="q" placeholder="Go to a Website">
  <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>
```
## Autofocus Field
Web sites can use JavaScript to focus the first input field of a web form automatically. For example, the home page of Google.com will autofocus the input box so you can type your search keywords. While this is convenient for most people, it can be annoying for power users or people with special needs. If you press the space bar expecting to scroll the page, the page will not scroll because the focus is already in a form input field.
Because the autofocusing is done with JavaScript, it can be tricky to handle all of these edge cases, and there is little recourse for people who don’t want a web page to “steal” the focus.

To solve this problem, HTML5 introduces an autofocus attribute on all web form controls. The autofocus attribute does exactly what it says on the tin: as soon as the page loads, it moves the input focus to a particular input field. But because it’s just markup instead of script, the behavior will be consistent across all web sites. Also, browser vendors (or extension authors) can offer users a way to disable the autofocusing behavior.

Here’s how you can set a form field to autofocus:
```html
<form>
  <input name="q" autofocus>
  <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>
```
### Setting autofocus as early as posible
Lots of web pages wait until window.onload fires to set focus. But the window.onload event doesn’t fire until after all your images have loaded. If your page has a lot of images, such a naive script could potentially re-focus the field after the user has started interacting with another part of your page. This is why power users hate autofocus scripts.
If you can’t insert a script in the middle of your page, you should set focus during a custom event like jQuery’s $(document).ready() instead of window.onload.
```html
<head>
<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    if (!("autofocus" in document.createElement("input"))) {
      $("#q").focus();
    }
  });
</script>
</head>
<body>
<form name="f">
  <input id="q" autofocus>
  <input type="submit" value="Go">
</form>
```
jQuery fires its custom ready event as soon as the page DOM is available — that is, it waits until the page text is loaded, but it doesn’t wait until all the images are loaded. This is not an optimal approach — if the page is unusually large or the network connection is unusually slow, a user could still start interacting with the page before your focus script executes. But it is still far better than waiting until the window.onload event fires.
If you are willing and able to insert a single script statement in your page markup, there is a middle ground that is less offensive than the first option and more optimal than the second. You can use jQuery’s custom events to define your own event, say autofocus_ready. Then you can trigger this event manually, immediately after the autofocus form field is available.
```html
<head>
<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
  $(document).bind('autofocus_ready', function() {
    if (!("autofocus" in document.createElement("input"))) {
      $("#q").focus();
    }
  });
</script>
</head>
<body>
<form name="f">
  <input id="q" autofocus>
  <script>$(document).trigger('autofocus_ready');</script>
  <input type="submit" value="Go">
</form>
```
- Setting focus properly is important.
- If at all possible, let the browser do it by setting the autofocus attribute on the form field you want to have focus.
- If you code a fallback for older browsers, detect support for the autofocus attribute to make sure your fallback is only executed in older browsers.
- Set focus as early as possible. Insert the focus script into your markup immediately after the form field. If that offends you, use a JavaScript library that supports custom events, and trigger a custom event immediately after the form field markup. If that’s not possible, use something like jQuery’s $(document).ready() event.
- Under no circumstances should you wait until window.onload to set focus.

| plain text      | <input type="text">     | the type attribute can be omitted            |

All of these input types still work in HTML5. If you’re “upgrading to HTML5” (perhaps by changing your DOCTYPE), you don’t need to make a single change to your web forms. Hooray for backward compatibility!

However, HTML5 defines 13 new field types, and for reasons that will become clear in a moment, there is no reason not to start using them.

The first of these new input types is for email addresses. It looks like this:
```html
<form>
  <input type="email">
  <input type="submit" value="Go">
</form>
```
To sum up: there’s no downside to converting all your email address form fields to type="email" immediately. Virtually no one will even notice, except iPhone users, who probably won’t notice either. But the ones who do notice will smile quietly and thank you for making their web experience just a little easier.
## Web addresses
Web addresses — which standards wonks call URLs, except for a few pedants which call them URIs — are another type of specialized text. The syntax of a web address is constrained by the relevant Internet standards. If someone asks you to enter a web address into a form, they’re expecting something like “http://www.google.com/”, not “125 Farwood Road.” Forward slashes are common — even Google’s home page has three of them. Periods are also common, but spaces are forbidden. And every web address has a domain suffix like “.com” or “.org”.
## Numbers as spinboxes
Asking for a number is trickier than asking for an email address or web address. First of all, numbers are more complicated than you might think. Quick: pick a number. -1? No, I meant a number between 1 and 10. 7½? No no, not a fraction, silly. π? Now you’re just being irrational.

My point is, you don’t often ask for “just a number.” It’s more likely that you’ll ask for a number in a particular range. You may only want certain kinds of numbers within that range — maybe whole numbers but not fractions or decimals, or something more esoteric like numbers divisible by 10. HTML5 has you covered.
```html
<input type="number"
       min="0"
       max="10"
       step="2"
       value="6">
```
Let’s take that one attribute at a time. (You can follow along with a live example if you like.)

- type="number" means that this is a number field.
- min="0" specifies the minimum acceptable value for this field.
- max="10" is the maximum acceptable value.
- step="2", combined with the min value, defines the acceptable numbers in the range: 0, 2, 4, and so on, up to the max value.
- value="6" is the default value. This should look familiar. It’s the same attribute name you’ve always used to specify values for form fields. (I mention it here to drive home the point that HTML5 builds on previous versions of HTML. You don’t need to relearn how to do stuff you’re already doing.)

That’s the markup side of a number field. Keep in mind that all of those attributes are optional. If you have a minimum but no maximum, you can specify a min attribute but no max attribute. The default step value is 1, and you can omit the step attribute unless you need a different step value. If there’s no default value, then the value attribute can be the empty string or even omitted altogether.

But HTML5 doesn’t stop there. For the same low, low price of free, you get these handy JavaScript methods as well:

- input.stepUp(n) increases the field’s value by n.
- input.stepDown(n) decreases the field’s value by n.
- input.valueAsNumber returns the current value as a floating point number. (The input.value property is always a string.)

## Number as sliders
Spinboxes are not the only way to represent numeric input. You’ve probably also seen “slider”
You can now have slider controls in your web forms, too. The markup looks eerily similar to spinbox controls:
```html
<input type="range"
       min="0"
       max="10"
       step="2"
       value="6">
```
All the available attributes are the same as type="number" — min, max, step, value — and they mean the same thing. The only difference is the user interface. Instead of a field for typing, browsers are expected to render type="range" as a slider control. Safari, Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer 10, and the iPhone running iOS 5 all do this. (Sadly, the iPhone running older versions of iOS renders it as a simple text box. It doesn’t even optimize its on-screen keyboard for numeric input.) All other browsers simply treat the field as type="text", so there’s no reason you can’t start using it immediately.
## Data pickers
HTML5 finally defines a way to include a native date picker control without having to script it yourself. In fact, it defines six: date, month, week, time, date + time, and date + time - timezone.
This is how Opera renders ``<input type="date">``:
Img_date
If you need a time to go with that date, Opera also supports ``<input type="datetime">``:
Img_datetime
If you only need a month + year (perhaps a credit card expiration date), Opera can render a ``<input type="month">``:
Img_month
Less common, but also available, is the ability to pick a specific week of a year with ``<input type="week">``:
Img_week
Last but not least, you can pick a time with ``<input type="time">``:
Img_time
## Search Boxes
OK, this one is subtle. Well, the idea is simple enough, but the implementations may require some explanation. Here goes…

Search. Not just Google Search or Yahoo Search. (Well, those too.) Think of any search box, on any page, on any site. Amazon has a search box. Newegg has a search box. Most blogs have a search box. How are they marked up? <input type="text">, just like every other text box on the web. Let’s fix that.
```html
<form>
  <input name="q" type="search">
  <input type="submit" value="Find">
</form>
```
## Color Pickers
HTML5 also defines ``<input type="color">``, which lets you pick a color and returns the color’s hexadecimal representation.
Img_Color
## Form Validation
Consider the common problem of entering an email address into a web form. You probably have some client-side validation in JavaScript, followed by server-side validation in PHP or Python or some other server-side scripting language. HTML5 can never replace your server-side validation, but it might someday replace your client-side validation.
There are two big problems with validating email addresses in JavaScript:

1. A surprising number of your visitors (probably around 10%) won’t have JavaScript enabled
2. You’ll get it wrong

## Required Fields
HTML5 form validation isn’t limited to the type of each field. You can also specify that certain fields are required. Required fields must have a value before you can submit the form.

The markup for required fields is as simple as can be:
```html
<form>
  <input id="q" required>
  <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>
```
