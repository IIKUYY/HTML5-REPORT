## Microdata
Microdata annotates the DOM with scoped name/value pairs from custom vocabularies.
Microdata centers around custom vocabularies. Think of “the set of all HTML5 elements” as one vocabulary. This vocabulary includes elements to represent a section or an article, but it doesn’t include elements to represent a person or an event. If you want to represent a person on a web page, you’ll need to define your own vocabulary. Microdata lets you do this. Anyone can define a microdata vocabulary and start embedding custom properties in their own web pages.
The next thing to know about microdata is that it works with name/value pairs. Every microdata vocabulary defines a set of named properties. For example, a Person vocabulary could define properties like name and photo. To include a specific microdata property on your web page, you provide the property name in a specific place.
Now, I’ve already touched on the DOM, but let me elaborate on that. Microdata is about applying additional semantics to data that’s already visible on your web page. Microdata is not designed to be a standalone data format. It’s a complement to HTML.

Does this sentence make more sense now? “Microdata annotates the DOM with scoped name/value pairs from custom vocabularies.” I hope so. Let’s see it in action.
## Microdata Model
Defining your own microdata vocabulary is easy. First, you need a namespace, which is just a URL. The namespace URL could actually point to a working web page, although that’s not strictly required. Let’s say I want to create a microdata vocabulary that describes a person. If I own the data-vocabulary.org domain, I’ll use the URL http://data-vocabulary.org/Person as the namespace for my microdata vocabulary. That’s an easy way to create a globally unique identifier: pick a URL on a domain that you control.

In this vocabulary, I need to define some named properties. Let’s start with three basic properties:

- name (your full name)
- photo (a link to a picture of you)
- url (a link to a site associated with you, like a weblog or a Google profile)

Some of these properties are URLs, others are plain text. Each of them lends itself to a natural form of markup, even before you start thinking about microdata or vocabularies or whatnot. Imagine that you have a profile page or an “about” page. Your name is probably marked up as a heading, like an `<h1>` element. Your photo is probably an `<img>` element, since you want people to see it. And any URLs associated your profile are probably already marked up as hyperlinks, because you want people to be able to click them. For the sake of discussion, let’s say your entire profile is also wrapped in a `<section>` element to separate it from the rest of the page content. Thus:
```html
<section>
  <h1>Mark Pilgrim</h1>
  <p><img src="http://www.example.com/photo.jpg" 
          alt="[me smiling]"></p>
  <p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/">
          weblog</a></p>
</section>
```
Microdata’s data model is name/value pairs. A microdata property name (like name or photo or url in this example) is always declared on an HTML element. The corresponding property value is then taken from the element’s DOM. For most HTML elements, the property value is simply the text content of the element. But there are a handful of exceptions.
| Element        | Value              |
| ---------------|--------------------|
| <meta>         | content attribute  |
| <audio>        | src attribute      |
| <embed>        | src attribute      |
| <iframe>       | src attribute      |
| <img>          | src attribute      |
| <source>       | src attribute      |
| <video>        | src attribute      |
| <a>            | href attribute     |
| <area>         | href attribute     |
| <link>         | href attribute     |
| <object>       | data attribute     |
| <time>         | datatime attribute |
| other elements | text content       |
“Adding microdata” to your page is a matter of adding a few attributes to the HTML elements you already have. The first thing you always do is declare which microdata vocabulary you’re using, by adding an itemtype attribute. The second thing you always do is declare the scope of the vocabulary, using an itemscope attribute.
```html
 <section itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Person">
 ```
 Your name is the first bit of data within the <section> element. It’s wrapped in an <h1> element. The <h1> element doesn’t have any special processing in the HTML5 microdata data model, so it falls under the “all other elements” rule where the microdata property value is simply the text content of an element.
 ```html
   <h1 itemprop="name">Mark Pilgrim</h1>
```
This is supposed to be a URL. According to the HTML5 microdata data model, the “value” of an <img> element is its src attribute. Hey look, the URL of your profile photo is already in an <img src> attribute. All you need to do is declare that the <img> element is the photo property.
```html
  <p><img itemprop="photo"
          src="http://www.example.com/photo.jpg"
          alt="[me smiling]"></p>
```
Finally, the url property is also a URL. According to the HTML5 microdata data model, the “value” of an <a> element is its href attribute. And once again, this fits perfectly with your existing markup. All you need to do is say that your existing <a> element is the url property:
```html
  <a itemprop="url" 
     href="http://diveintomark.org/">dive into mark</a>
```
For marking up the name property, just add an itemprop attribute on the table cell that contains the name. Table cells have no special rules in the microdata property value table, so they get the default value, “the microdata property is the text content.”
```html
<TABLE itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Person">
  <TR><TD>Name<TD>Mark Pilgrim
  <TR><TD>Link<TD>
    <span itemprop="url">
      <A href=# onclick=goExternalLink()>http://diveintomark.org/</A>
    </span>
</TABLE>
```
## Marking up people
The easiest way to integrate microdata into a personal website is on your “about” page. You do have an “about” page, don’t you? If not, you can follow along as I extend this sample “about” page with additional semantics. The final result is here: person-plus-microdata.html.
The first thing you always need to do is declare the vocabulary you’re using, and the scope of the properties you want to add. You do this by adding the itemtype and itemscope attributes on the outermost element that contains the other elements that contain the actual data. In this case, that’s a <section> element.
```html
<section itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Person">
```
Now you can start defining microdata properties from the http://data-vocabulary.org/Person vocabulary. But what are those properties? As it happens, you can see the list of properties by navigating to data-vocabulary.org/Person in your browser. The microdata specification does not require this, but I’d say it’s certainly a “best practice.” After all, if you want developers to actually use your microdata vocabulary, you need to document it.
| Property     | Description                                                                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name         | Name                                                                             |
| nickname     | Nickname                                                                         |
| photo        | An image link                                                                    |
| title        | The person's title                                                               |
| rol          | The person's rol                                                                 |
| url          | Link to a web page                                                               |
| affiliation  | The name of an organization with which the person is associated                  |
| friend       | Identifies a social relationship between the person described and another person |
| contact      | Identifies a social relationship between the person described and another person |
| acquaintance | Identifies a social relationship between the person described and another person |
| addres       | The location of the person.                                                      |
Notes:
titles, affiliations and roles, can be written together but listed separeted, Ex
```html
  <dt>Position</dt>
    <dd><span itemprop="title">Developer advocate</span> for
        <span itemprop="affiliation">Google, Inc.<span></dd>
```
Specific addres data are listed separete from each other.
The properties are:
- Person
- Person.address
- Person.address.street-address
- Person.address.locality
- Person.address.region
- Person.address.postal-code
- Person.address.country-name

Ex.
```html
 <dd itemprop="address" itemscope
        itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address">
      <span itemprop="street-address">100 Main Street</span><br>
      <span itemprop="locality">Anytown</span>,
      <span itemprop="region">PA</span>
      <span itemprop="postal-code">19999</span>
      <span itemprop="country-name">USA</span>
    </dd>
  </dl>
```
According to the HTML5 microdata data model, <a> elements have special processing. The microdata property value is the href attribute, not the child text content. The text of each link is actually ignored by a microdata processor.
### Google rich snipets
There are two major classes of applications that consume HTML, and by extension, HTML5 microdata:

1. Web browsers
2. Search engines

For browsers, HTML5 defines a set of DOM APIs for extracting microdata items, properties, and property values from a web page. At time of writing (February 2011), no browser supports this API. Not a single one. So that’s… kind of a dead end, at least until browsers catch up and implement the client-side APIs.

The other major consumer of HTML is search engines. What could a search engine do with microdata properties about a person? Imagine this: instead of simply displaying the page title and an excerpt of text, the search engine could integrate some of that structured information and display it. Full name, job title, employer, address, maybe even a little thumbnail of a profile photo. Would that catch your attention? It would catch mine.
When Google’s web crawler parses your page and finds microdata properties that conform to the http://data-vocabulary.org/Person vocabulary, it parses out those properties and stores them alongside the rest of the page data.
And how does Google use all of this information? That depends. There’s no hard and fast rules about how microdata properties should be displayed, which ones should be displayed, or whether they should be displayed at all. If someone searches for “Mark Pilgrim,” and Google determines that this “about” page should rank in the results, and Google decides that the microdata properties it originally found on that page are worth displaying.
This is really quite amazing. You don’t need to be a large corporation making special deals with search engine vendors to customize your search result listings. Just take ten minutes and add a couple of HTML attributes to annotate the data you were already publishing anyway.
## Marking up Organizations
Microdata isn’t limited to a single vocabulary. “About” pages are nice, but you probably only have one of them. Still hungry for more? Let’s learn how to mark up organizations and businesses.
As with marking up people, you need to set the itemscope and itemtype attributes on the outermost element. In this case, the outermost element is an <article> element. The itemtype attribute declares the microdata vocabulary you’re using (in this case, http://data-vocabulary.org/Organization), and the itemscope attribute declares that all of the properties you set on child elements relate to this vocabulary.
| Property | Description                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| name     | The name of the organization             |
| url      | Link to the organization’s home page     |
| address  | The location of the organization. Can contain the subproperties street-address, locality, region, postal-code, and country-name.                        |
| tel      | The telephone number of the organization |
| geo      | Specifies the geographical coordinates of the location. Always contains two subproperties, latitude and longitude.                                            |
geolocation information isn’t like that. There is no visible text that gives the exact latitude and longitude (to four decimal places!) of the Organization. In fact, the organization.html example (without microdata) has no geolocation information at all. It has a link to Google Maps, but even the URL of that link does not contain latitude and longitude coordinates. (It contains similar information in a Google-specific format.) But even if we had a link to a hypothetical online mapping service that did take latitude and longitude coordinates as URL parameters, microdata has no way of separating out the different parts of a URL. You can’t declare that the first URL query parameter is the latitude and the second URL query parameter is the longitude and the rest of the query parameters are irrelevant.
Geolocation information is defined in its own vocabulary, like the address of a Person or Organization. Therefore, this <span> element needs three attributes:

1. itemprop="geo" says that this element represents the geo property of the surrounding Organization
2. itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Geo" says which microdata vocabulary this element’s properties conform to
3. itemscope says that this element is the enclosing element for a microdata item with its own vocabulary (given in the itemtype attribute). All the properties within this element are properties of http://data-vocabulary.org/Geo, not the surrounding http://data-vocabulary.org/Organization.

## Mark up Events
The URL for the Event vocabulary is http://data-vocabulary.org/Event, which also happens to contain a nice little chart describing the vocabulary’s properties.
| Property    | Description                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| summary     | The name of the event                                                              |
| url         | Link to the event details page                                                     |
| location    | The location or venue of the event.                                                |
| description | A description of the event                                                         |
| startDate   | The starting date and time of the event in ISO date format                         |
| endDate     | The ending date and time of the event in ISO date format                           |
| duration    | The duration date of the event in ISO duration format                              |
| eventType   | The category of the event, This is a freeform string, not an enumerated attribute. |
| geo         | Specifies the geographical coordinates of the location. Always contains two subproperties, latitude and longitude.                                                                                         |
| photo       | A link to a photo or image related to the event                                    |
The next bit is something new. Events generally occur on specific dates and start and end at specific times. In HTML5, dates and times should be marked up with the <time> element, and we are already doing that here. So the question becomes, how do we add microdata propeties to these <time> elements? Looking back at the HTML5 microdata data model, we see that the <time> element has special processing. The value of a microdata property on a <time> element is the value of the datetime attribute. And hey, the startDate and endDate properties of the Event vocabulary take an ISO-style date, just like the datetime property of a <time> element. Once again, the semantics of the core HTML vocabulary dovetail nicely with semantics of our custom microdata vocabulary. Marking up start and end dates with microdata is as simple as
1. Using HTML correctly in the first place (using <time> elements to mark up dates and times), and
2. Adding a single itemprop attribute
```html
  <p>
    <time itemprop="startDate" 
          datetime="2009-11-06T08:30+01:00">2009 November 6, 8:30</time>
      &ndash;
    <time itemprop="endDate" 
          datetime="2009-11-06T20:30+01:00">20:30</time>
  </p>
```
Now we’re back to defining properties on the Event. The next property is geo, to represent the physical location of the Event. This uses the same Geo vocabulary that we used to mark up the physical location of an Organization in the previous section. We need a `<span>` element to act as the container; it gets the itemtype and itemscope attributes. Within that `<span>` element, we need two `<meta>` elements, one for the latitude property and one for the longitude property.
```html
  <span itemprop="geo" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Geo">
    <meta itemprop="latitude" content="50.047893" />
    <meta itemprop="longitude" content="14.4491" />
  </span>
```
### Google snipets
According to Google’s Rich Snippets Testing Tool, this is the information that Google’s crawlers will glean from our sample event listing page
Properties that are separate microdata items are given internal IDs (Item(__1), Item(__2) and so on). This is not part of the microdata specification. It’s just a convention that Google’s testing tool uses to linearize the sample output and show you the grouping of nested items and their properties.
## Marking up reviews
Here’s another example of making the web (and possibly search result listings) better through markup: business and product reviews.

This is a short review I wrote of my favorite pizza place near my house. (This is a real restaurant, by the way. If you’re ever in Apex
This review is contained in an <article> element, so that’s where we’ll put the itemtype and itemscope attributes. The namespace URL for this vocabulary is http://data-vocabulary.org/Review.
| Property     | Description                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| itemreviewed | The name of the item being reviewed. Can be a product, service, business, etc. |
| rating       | A numerical quality rating for the item, on a scale from 1 to 5. Can also be a nested http://data-vocabulary.org/Rating vocabulary to use a nonstandard scale.                        |
| reviewer     | The name of the author who wrote the review                                    |
| dtreviewed   | The date that the item was reviewed in ISO date format                         |
| summary      | A short summary of the review                                                  |
| description  | 	The body of the review                                                      |
The next two properties are also straightforward. The summary property is a short description of what you’re reviewing, and the description property is the body of the review.
```html
  <p itemprop="summary">New York-style pizza right in historic downtown Apex</p>
  <p itemprop="description">
    Food is top-notch. Atmosphere is just right for a “neighborhood
    pizza joint.” The restaurant itself is a bit cramped; if you’re
    overweight, you may have difficulty getting in and out of your
    seat and navigating between other tables. Used to give free
    garlic knots when you sat down; now they give you plain bread
    and you have to pay for the good stuff. Overall, it’s a winner.
  </p>
```
OK, let’s talk ratings. The trickiest part of marking up a review is the rating. By default, ratings in the Review vocabulary are on a scale of 1–5, 1 being “terrible” and 5 being “awesome.” If you want to use a different scale, you can definitely do that. But let’s talk about the default scale first.
```html
  <p>★★★★☆ (<span itemprop="rating">4</span> stars out of 5)</p>
  ```
