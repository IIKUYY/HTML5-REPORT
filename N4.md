# Chapter 4
## Canvas
HTML 5 defines the <canvas> element as “a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly, So what does a canvas look like? Nothing, really. A <canvas> element has no content and no border of its own.
```html
<canvas width="300" height="225"></canvas>
```
to draw something in the canvas you can use a code like this.
```html
function draw_b() {
  var b_canvas = document.getElementById("b");
  var b_context = b_canvas.getContext("2d");
  b_context.fillRect(50, 25, 150, 100);
}
```

So, you have a <canvas> element, and you have its drawing context. The drawing context is where all the drawing methods and properties are defined. There’s a whole group of properties and methods devoted to drawing rectangles:

- The fillStyle property can be a CSS color, a pattern, or a gradient. (More on gradients shortly.) The default fillStyle is solid black, but you can set it to whatever you like. Each drawing context remembers its own properties as long as the page is open, unless you do something to reset it.
- fillRect(x, y, width, height) draws a rectangle filled with the current fill style.
- The strokeStyle property is like fillStyle — it can be a CSS color, a pattern, or a gradient.
- strokeRect(x, y, width, height) draws an rectangle with the current stroke style. strokeRect doesn’t fill in the middle; it just draws the edges.
- clearRect(x, y, width, height) clears the pixels in the specified rectangle.

## Canvas Coordinates
The canvas is a two-dimensional grid. The coordinate (0, 0) is at the upper-left corner of the canvas. Along the X-axis, values increase towards the right edge of the canvas. Along the Y-axis, values increase towards the bottom edge of the canvas.
## Paths
Each canvas has a path. Defining the path is like drawing with a pencil. You can draw whatever you like, but it won’t be part of the finished product until you pick up the quill and trace over your path in ink.

To draw straight lines in pencil, you use the following two methods:

- moveTo(x, y) moves the pencil to the specified starting point.
- lineTo(x, y) draws a line to the specified ending point.

Ex. For vertical lines
```html
for (var x = 0.5; x < 500; x += 10) {
  context.moveTo(x, 0);
  context.lineTo(x, 375);
}
```
Ex. For horizontal lines
```html
for (var y = 0.5; y < 375; y += 10) {
  context.moveTo(0, y);
  context.lineTo(500, y);
}
```
Those were all “pencil” methods. Nothing has actually been drawn on the canvas yet. We need an “ink” method to make it permanent.
```html
context.strokeStyle = "#eee";
context.stroke();
```
Ex of a path trace
```html
context.beginPath();
context.moveTo(0, 40);
context.lineTo(240, 40);
context.moveTo(260, 40);
context.lineTo(500, 40);
context.moveTo(495, 35);
context.lineTo(500, 40);
context.lineTo(495, 45);
```
## Text
In addition to drawing lines on a canvas, you can also draw text on a canvas. Unlike text on the surrounding web page, there is no box model. That means none of the familiar CSS layout techniques are available: no floats, no margins, no padding, no word wrapping. (Maybe you think that’s a good thing!) You can set a few font attributes, then you pick a point on the canvas and draw your text there.

The following font attributes are available on the drawing context:

- font can be anything you would put in a CSS font rule. That includes font style, font variant, font weight, font size, line height, and font family.
- textAlign controls text alignment. It is similar (but not identical) to a CSS text-align rule. Possible values are start, end, left, right, and center.
- textBaseline controls where the text is drawn relative to the starting point. Possible values are top, hanging, middle, alphabetic, ideographic, or bottom.

Ex. of text drawing
```html
context.font = "bold 12px sans-serif";
context.fillText("x", 248, 43);
context.fillText("y", 58, 165);
```
## Gradients
You can also draw lines with a gradient and not only solid color.

The markup looks the same as any other canvas.
```html
<canvas id="d" width="300" height="225"></canvas>
```
First, we need to find the <canvas> element and its drawing context.
```html
var d_canvas = document.getElementById("d");
var context = d_canvas.getContext("2d");
```
Once we have the drawing context, we can start to define a gradient. A gradient is a smooth transition between two or more colors. The canvas drawing context supports two types of gradients:

- createLinearGradient(x0, y0, x1, y1) paints along a line from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1).
- createRadialGradient(x0, y0, r0, x1, y1, r1) paints along a cone between two circles. The first three parameters represent the start - - circle, with origin (x0, y0) and radius r0. The last three parameters represent the end circle, with origin (x1, y1) and radius r1.

Let’s make a linear gradient. Gradients can be any size, but I’ll make this gradient be 300 pixels wide, like the canvas.
```html
var my_gradient = context.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 300, 0);
```
Let’s define a gradient that shades from black to white.
```html
my_gradient.addColorStop(0, "black");
my_gradient.addColorStop(1, "white");
```
Defining a gradient doesn’t draw anything on the canvas. It’s just an object tucked away in memory somewhere. To draw a gradient, you set your fillStyle to the gradient and draw a shape, like a rectangle or a line.
```html
context.fillStyle = my_gradient;
context.fillRect(0, 0, 300, 225);
```
this make a gradient black in the left to white in the right
```html
var my_gradient = context.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 0, 225);
my_gradient.addColorStop(0, "black");
my_gradient.addColorStop(1, "white");
context.fillStyle = my_gradient;
context.fillRect(0, 0, 300, 225);
```
And this make a gradient black in the top to white in the bottom.
## Images
The canvas drawing context defines a drawImage() method for drawing an image on a canvas. The method can take three, five, or nine arguments.

- drawImage(image, dx, dy) takes an image and draws it on the canvas. The given coordinates (dx, dy) will be the upper-left corner of the image. Coordinates (0, 0) would draw the image at the upper-left corner of the canvas.
- drawImage(image, dx, dy, dw, dh) takes an image, scales it to a width of dw and a height of dh, and draws it on the canvas at coordinates (dx, dy).
- drawImage(image, sx, sy, sw, sh, dx, dy, dw, dh) takes an image, clips it to the rectangle (sx, sy, sw, sh), scales it to dimensions (dw, dh), and draws it on the canvas at coordinates (dx, dy).

If you’re using an existing <img> element, you can safely draw it on the canvas during the window.onload event.
```html
<img id="cat" src="images/cat.png" alt="sleeping cat" width="177" height="113">
<canvas id="e" width="177" height="113"></canvas>
<script>
window.onload = function() {
  var canvas = document.getElementById("e");
  var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
  var cat = document.getElementById("cat");
  context.drawImage(cat, 0, 0);
};
</script>
```
If you’re creating the image object entirely in JavaScript, you can safely draw the image on the canvas during the Image.onload event.
```html
<canvas id="e" width="177" height="113"></canvas>
<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById("e");
  var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
  var cat = new Image();
  cat.src = "images/cat.png";
  cat.onload = function() {
    context.drawImage(cat, 0, 0);
  };
</script>
```
