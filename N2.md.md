## Detection Techniques
Document Object Model (DOM) are the elements that the browser render based on the HTML code, some browser can or can´t render some of this DOMs, there are four simple steps to now if your browser can render th DOM you want
1. Check if a certain property exists on a global object (such as window or navigator).
2. Create an element, then check if a certain property exists on that element.
3. Create an element, check if a certain method exists on that element, then call the method and check the value it returns.
4. Create an element, set a property to a certain value, then check if the property has retained its value.

## Modernizr
Modernizr is an open source, MIT-licensed JavaScript library that detects support for many HTML5 & CSS3 features.
The code line is <script src="modernizr.min.js"></script>
Ex.
```
if (Modernizr.canvas) {
  // let's draw some shapes!
} else {
  // no native canvas support available :(
}
```
## Canvas
The canvas is the MIME type that render all kind of grapichs, from images to game graphics, If your browser supports the canvas API, the DOM object it creates to represent a <canvas> element will have a getContext() method.
Ex. 
```
function supports_canvas() {
  return !!document.createElement('canvas').getContext;
}
```
This function will detect support for most of the canvas API, including shapes, paths, gradients & patterns. It will not detect the third-party explorercanvas library that implements the canvas API in Microsoft Internet Explorer.
The text canvas is other story, it was added later to the API, some browser aren´t compatible for this reason, If your browser supports the canvas API, the DOM object it creates to represent a <canvas> element will have the getContext() method.
Ex. 
```
function supports_canvas_text() {
  if (!supports_canvas()) { return false; }
  var dummy_canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  var context = dummy_canvas.getContext('2d');
  return typeof context.fillText == 'function';
}
```
## Video
The <video> element is designed to be usable without any detection scripts. You can specify multiple video files, and browsers that support HTML5 video will choose one based on what video formats they support. If your browser don´t support the video API, you can use a third party plugins, if you want your video to do something more than play, you need to use JavaScript.
If your browser supports HTML5 video, the DOM object it creates to represent a <video> element will have a canPlayType() method.
Ex. 
```
function supports_video() {
  return !!document.createElement('video').canPlayType;
}
```
The “language” of a video is called a “codec”, your browser needs to be compatible with the codec in order to play the video, perhaps there a hundreds of codecs the main browsers support similar codecs, Safari runs in a codec that cost money, Chrome and Mozilla run on a free codec.
If your browser supports HTML5 video, the DOM object it creates to represent a <video> element will have a canPlayType() method.
Ex. 
```
function supports_h264_baseline_video() {
  if (!supports_video()) { return false; }
  var v = document.createElement("video");
  return v.canPlayType('video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"');
}
```
## Local Storage
HTML5 storage provides a way for web sites to store information on your computer and retrieve it later. The concept is similar to cookies, but it’s designed for larger quantities of information.
If your browser supports HTML5 storage, there will be a localStorage property on the global window object.
Ex. 
```
function supports_local_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch(e){
    return false;
  }
  ```
## Web Workers
Web Workers provide a standard way for browsers to run JavaScript in the background. With web workers, you can spawn multiple “threads” that all run at the same time.
f your browser supports the Web Worker API, there will be a Worker property on the global window object.
Ex. 
```
function supports_web_workers() {
  return !!window.Worker;
}
```
## Offline Web Applications
The first time you visit an offline-enabled web site, the web server tells your browser which files it needs in order to work offline. These files can be anything — HTML, JavaScript, images, even videos. Once your browser downloads all the necessary files, you can revisit the web site even if you’re not connected to the Internet.
If your browser supports offline web applications, there will be an applicationCache property on the global window object.
Ex. 
```
function supports_offline() {
  return !!window.applicationCache;
}
```
## Geolocation
Geolocation is the art of figuring out where you are in the world and (optionally) sharing that information with people you trust. There is more than one way to figure out where you are.
If your browser supports the geolocation API, there will be a geolocation property on the global navigator object.
Ex. **function supports_geolocation() {
  return 'geolocation' in navigator;
}**
## Input Types
1. <input type="search"> for search boxes
2. <input type="number"> for spinboxes
3. <input type="range"> for sliders
4. <input type="color"> for color pickers
5. <input type="tel"> for telephone numbers
6. <input type="url"> for web addresses
7. <input type="email"> for email addresses
8. <input type="date"> for calendar date pickers
9. <input type="month"> for months
10. <input type="week"> for weeks
11. <input type="time"> for timestamps
12. <input type="datetime"> for precise, absolute date+time stamps
13. <input type="datetime-local"> for local dates and times

to detect support for all the new input types you can use Modernizr
## Placeholder Text
Placeholder text is displayed inside the input field as long as the field is empty and not focused. As soon you click on (or tab to) the input field, the placeholder text disappears.
f your browser supports placeholder text in input fields, the DOM object it creates to represent an <input> element will have a placeholder property (even if you don’t include a placeholder attribute in your HTML).
Ex. 
```
function supports_input_placeholder() {
  var i = document.createElement('input');
  return 'placeholder' in i;
}
```
## Form Autofocus
Autofocus is when in a page, some input is automatically focus, like the input box in google.
If your browser supports autofocusing web form controls, the DOM object it creates to represent an <input> element will have an autofocus property (even if you don’t include the autofocus attribute in your HTML).
Ex. 
```function supports_input_autofocus() {
  var i = document.createElement('input');
  return 'autofocus' in i;
}
```
## Microdata
Microdata is a standardized way to provide additional semantics in your web pages. For example, you can use microdata to declare that a photograph is available under a specific Creative Commons license.
f your browser supports the HTML5 microdata API, there will be a getItems() function on the global document object.
Ex. 
```
function supports_microdata_api() {
  return !!document.getItems;
}
```
## History API
The HTML5 history API is a standardized way to manipulate the browser history via script. Part of this API — navigating the history — has been available in previous versions of HTML. The new part in HTML5 is a way to add entries to the browser history.
If your browser supports the HTML5 history API, there will be a pushState() function on the global history object.
Ex.
```
function supports_history_api() {
  return !!(window.history && history.pushState);
}
```
